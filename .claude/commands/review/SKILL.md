# Code Review

Perform a rigorous, senior-engineer-level code review of all uncommitted changes in the working tree.

## Core Principles

- **You are a strict reviewer, not a rubber-stamper.** Flag real problems. Do not praise code just to be nice.
- **Never make changes directly.** Your output is a review report and an optional change plan. Wait for explicit user approval before editing any file.
- **Ask questions when intent is ambiguous.** If you cannot tell whether something is intentional or a mistake, ask.
- **Focus on substance over style.** Formatting issues caught by linters are low priority. Logic errors, security holes, and architectural violations are high priority.

## Workflow

### Phase 1 — Gather the diff

Run these commands to understand the full scope of uncommitted work:

```bash
# Overview of changed files
git status

# Full diff of all tracked changes (staged + unstaged)
git diff HEAD

# List of untracked files that may need review
git ls-files --others --exclude-standard
```

Read the diff carefully. For every changed file, also read the **full file** (not just the diff hunk) so you understand the surrounding context — imports, class hierarchy, sibling functions, and call sites.

### Phase 2 — Understand context

For each changed file:

1. Read the file's component-level `README.md` if one exists (e.g., `reflexio/server/README.md`).
2. Identify the module's responsibility and how it fits into the overall architecture.
3. If the change touches an interface consumed by other modules (API schema, service base class, client method), find and read the consumers.
4. If tests are changed, read the application code under test. If application code is changed, check whether corresponding tests exist and whether they cover the new behavior.

### Phase 3 — Review checklist

Evaluate every change against the following categories. Only report findings that are **actionable** — skip categories where everything looks correct.

#### 3.1 Correctness & Logic
- Are there off-by-one errors, wrong comparisons, or logic inversions?
- Are edge cases handled (empty inputs, None/null, zero-length collections, boundary values)?
- Do conditional branches cover all expected states?
- Are return types consistent with what callers expect?
- Is async/await used correctly (no missing awaits, no blocking calls in async context)?

#### 3.2 Architecture & Design
- Does the change follow existing patterns in the codebase? If it deviates, is the deviation justified?
- Are responsibilities placed in the right layer (API route vs. service vs. utility)?
- Is there unnecessary coupling between modules that should be independent?
- Are new abstractions justified, or do they add complexity without benefit?
- Does the change violate separation of concerns?
- If a new service/extractor/endpoint is added, does it follow the established pattern?

#### 3.3 API & Contract Design
- Are request/response schemas complete and correct?
- Are field names consistent with existing conventions?
- Are optional vs. required fields set correctly?
- Are default values sensible?
- Is backward compatibility preserved where needed?
- Are enums used where a fixed set of values is expected?

#### 3.4 Security
- Is user input validated and sanitized before use?
- Are there SQL injection, command injection, or XSS risks?
- Are secrets or credentials hardcoded or logged?
- Are authorization checks in place for protected endpoints?
- Is sensitive data exposed in error messages or logs?
- Are file paths validated to prevent path traversal?

#### 3.5 Error Handling & Resilience
- Are exceptions caught at the right level (not swallowed silently, not leaking implementation details)?
- Are error messages actionable for the caller?
- Are external service failures handled gracefully (LLM calls, database, third-party APIs)?
- Is retry logic appropriate and bounded?
- Are resources cleaned up on failure (connections, file handles)?

#### 3.6 Type Safety & Data Integrity
- Are type hints present and correct on new/changed functions?
- Are Pydantic models used where structured validation is needed?
- Are there implicit type coercions that could cause subtle bugs?
- Are Optional types handled with proper None checks?
- Are union types narrowed before use?

#### 3.7 Performance
- Are there N+1 query patterns or unnecessary database round-trips?
- Are there large allocations or copies that could be avoided?
- Is pagination used for list endpoints?
- Are there blocking calls in async code paths?
- Is work being repeated that could be cached or deduped?

#### 3.8 Testing
- Do new features have corresponding tests?
- Do bug fixes include a regression test?
- Are tests testing behavior (not implementation details)?
- Are test assertions specific enough to catch regressions?
- Are mocks set up correctly (not masking real bugs)?
- Do tests cover both happy-path and error cases?

#### 3.9 Code Clarity & Maintainability
- Are variable and function names descriptive and consistent with codebase conventions?
- Is complex logic explained with a comment about *why* (not *what*)?
- Are there dead code paths, unreachable branches, or leftover debug code?
- Are magic numbers or strings extracted into named constants?
- Is duplication introduced that should be extracted into a shared utility?

#### 3.10 Frontend (when applicable)
- Are components following the project's ShadCN + Tailwind patterns?
- Is state management appropriate (server state vs. client state)?
- Are loading and error states handled in the UI?
- Is the UI consistent with existing pages?
- Are accessibility basics covered (labels, keyboard navigation)?

### Phase 4 — Ask clarifying questions

If during the review you encounter any of the following, **stop and ask the user before proceeding**:

- Intent is ambiguous — you cannot tell if something is a deliberate design choice or a mistake.
- A change conflicts with patterns documented in README files.
- A breaking change to a public interface may have been unintentional.
- A test is removed or weakened and it is unclear whether this is deliberate.
- New dependencies are added with no obvious justification.

Use the `AskUserQuestion` tool to ask focused, specific questions. Batch related questions together (up to 4 per round).

### Phase 5 — Produce the review report

Output a structured review report using this format:

```
## Code Review Summary

**Files reviewed:** <count>
**Scope:** <one-line description of what the changes do>

### Critical Issues (must fix)
Items that would cause bugs, security vulnerabilities, or data loss.
- [ ] **[FILE:LINE]** — Description of the issue and why it matters.

### Significant Issues (should fix)
Items that degrade code quality, violate architecture, or hurt maintainability.
- [ ] **[FILE:LINE]** — Description and recommendation.

### Minor Issues (nice to fix)
Items that are low-risk but would improve the code.
- [ ] **[FILE:LINE]** — Description and suggestion.

### Observations
Things that are not wrong but worth noting (e.g., "this module is growing large — consider splitting in the future").

### What looks good
Briefly note well-implemented aspects (1-3 bullet points max). Do not over-praise.
```

### Phase 6 — Propose change plan (if issues found)

If there are Critical or Significant issues, produce a concrete change plan:

```
## Proposed Changes

### Change 1: <short title>
**File:** <path>
**Issue:** <which review finding this addresses>
**What to change:** <specific description of the modification>

### Change 2: <short title>
...
```

Then explicitly ask the user:
> "Here is my review and proposed changes. Should I proceed with all changes, some of them, or none?"

**Do NOT make any edits until the user approves.**

## Severity Definitions

| Severity | Definition | Action |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| **Critical** | Will cause bugs, data loss, security vulnerability, or crash in production | Must fix before commit |
| **Significant** | Violates architecture, creates tech debt, missing error handling, missing tests | Should fix before commit |
| **Minor** | Naming, clarity, minor duplication, small improvements | Nice to have, can defer |
| **Observation** | Not a problem today but worth tracking | No action needed now |

## What This Review Does NOT Cover

- Formatting and whitespace (handled by pre-commit hooks)
- Import ordering (handled by linters)
- Line length (handled by linters)
- Whether the feature itself is a good idea (that is a product decision, not a code review)
