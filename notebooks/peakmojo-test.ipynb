The terms are dependent on your credit, as well as your business profile. The process works by connecting you with your funding advisor who will let you know the things they need from you. Essentially it's just four months of the most recent bank statements and some credit information and then we can get you a lending decision within 24 to 48 hours. Is that a timeline that works for you?   \n",
