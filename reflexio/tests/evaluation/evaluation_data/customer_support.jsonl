{"turn":6,"role":"agent","content":"Got it. What error are you seeing?","labels":[]}
{"turn":7,"role":"customer","content":"It says: S3 sync timeout after 900s. We store backups in AWS us-west-2, and the dataset is about 12 TB.","labels":[{"type":"explicit","content":"Customer runs backups in AWS us-west-2"},{"type":"explicit","content":"Customer backup dataset is about 12 TB"},{"type":"explicit","content":"Customer sees error: 'S3 sync timeout after 900s'"}]}
{"turn":8,"role":"agent","content":"Thanks Alex. You can try increasing the timeout value in the UI.","labels":[]}
{"turn":9,"role":"customer","content":"We already tried that. It helped a bit, but still fails on large jobs.","labels":[{"type":"implicit","content":"UI-based tuning alone is insufficient for customer’s large backup jobs"}]}
{"turn":10,"role":"agent","content":"In that case you could manually split your backups into smaller chunks.","labels":[]}
{"turn":11,"role":"customer","content":"That’s not really viable. We’re running this in CI pipelines and need it to be fully automated.","labels":[{"type":"implicit","content":"Customer rejects manual operational steps for core workflows"},{"type":"inferred","content":"Customer’s backup workflow must be automation-friendly and CI-compatible (inference from rejecting manual chunking + stating CI usage)"}]}
{"turn":12,"role":"agent","content":"Understood. We recommend using our enterprise batch backup tool.","labels":[]}

{"turn":14,"role":"agent","content":"Thanks for clarifying. You can use rclone with multipart uploads to S3 and configure parallel chunking. That will be more reliable for large datasets.","labels":[]}

{"turn":16,"role":"agent","content":"Do you want a step-by-step UI guide?","labels":[]}
{"turn":17,"role":"customer","content":"Not really. We’re very comfortable with CLI, Terraform, and YAML-based configs.

{"turn":21,"role":"agent","content":"Sure! Here’s a UI tutorial on setting up monitoring dashboards…","labels":[{"type":"feedback","content":"Agent incorrectly defaulted to a UI tutorial; should avoid assuming GUI-first solutions and instead match customer’s established CLI/config-as-code preference (generalizable mistake)"}]}
{"turn":22,"role":"customer","content":"Hmm — we usually don’t use UI dashboards. We prefer Prometheus plus alert rules as code.","labels":[{"type":"explicit","content":"Customer prefers Prometheus with alert rules as code"},{"type":"implicit","content":"Customer does not use UI dashboards for monitoring"},{"type":"feedback","content":"Do not recommend UI dashboards by default; offer monitoring-as-code (e.g., Prometheus + rules-as-code) especially for engineering/DevOps users (generalizable rule learned from correction)"}]}
{"turn":23,"role":"agent","content":"Thanks for pointing that out — sorry about that. Here is a Prometheus-based setup instead.","labels":[]}
{"turn":24,"role":"customer","content":"Much better.","labels":[{"type":"inferred","content":"Customer profile: automation-first, infrastructure-as-code, and monitoring-as-code engineering style (inference from CI automation requirement + Terraform/YAML comfort + rejection of UI dashboards + preference for Prometheus rules-as-code)"}]}
