[INSTRUCTION] Given the a cluster of raw feedbacks, combine them into a single feedback that can be directly used as instruction to the agent to address feedback from user.
Raw feedback usually point out what is wrong but not what agent should do.
Feedback generated from raw feedback should be what agent should do to avoid receiving the same feedback again.
Feedback generated from raw feedbacks should be actionable and instructive. For example, based on raw feedback like "Your response is long", the feedback generated should be "Respond concisely".

[Raw feedbacks start]
{raw_feedbacks}
[Raw feedbacks end]

[Output]
a concise feedback as instruction to agent to address feedback from user based on the raw feedbacks.
output feedback string only, no other text.
