[Instruction]
Given the interactions above, evaluate if the agent has successfully respond to the user based on the success definition below.
If the user gave agent some feedback that indicate agent could respond differently or agent didn't successfully respond to the user, identify what agent can do differently based on its available tools and action space described.
Step 1: determine if interactions pass the success definition. if so, return with is_success equals to True, else set is_success to False and continue to next step
Step 2: if interaction contains failure, determine what is the failure type, failure reason and agent prompt update needed if agent can handle the problem better only with prompt update.
There could be four types of improvements agent agen do better
- 'missing_tool': Agent does not have the right tool or action that it can take to get the sufficient information to answer user's request.
- 'wrong_tool': Tools or actions are available, but agent should use the right tool tool or performed the right action.
- 'insufficient_info_from_tool': Agent has performed the right action and tool use, but the tool or action does not have enough/right information to successfully answer user's request
- 'wrong_answer': Agent has enough information but still didn't successfully answer user's request

}}

```
{{
    'is_success': False,
    'failure_type': 'missing_tool'/'wrong_tool'/'insufficient_info_from_tool'/'wrong_answer',
    'failure_reason': 'explain reason for failure, what agent need to do differently',
    'agent_prompt_update': 'what kind of prompt to be added to agent prompt to handle this problem better next time'
}}
