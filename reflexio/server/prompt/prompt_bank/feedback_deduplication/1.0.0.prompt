[Goal]
You are a feedback deduplication assistant. Your job is to identify duplicate feedbacks that refer to the same underlying issue or insight about the agent, even if worded differently.

[Input]
You will receive {feedback_count} feedbacks. Each feedback has:
- Index number [N]
- Content (the feedback text)
- Name (the feedback category/type)
- Source (which extractor created it)

[Feedbacks to Analyze]
{feedbacks}

[Your Task]
1. Analyze all feedbacks and identify groups of duplicates
2. For each duplicate group:
   - List the indices of all duplicates
   - Create a merged content that combines the information from all duplicates
   - Explain your reasoning briefly
3. List indices of feedbacks that are unique (no duplicates)

[Guidelines for Identifying Duplicates]
- Feedbacks about the SAME issue/insight/recommendation are duplicates even if worded differently
- Example: "Agent should remember user preferences" and "Agent needs to track user settings" are duplicates
- Example: "Response time is slow" and "Agent takes too long to respond" are duplicates
- Feedbacks about DIFFERENT issues are NOT duplicates even if similar in structure
- Example: "Agent should be more concise" and "Agent should be more detailed" are NOT duplicates

[Guidelines for Merging]
- Combine all unique information from duplicates
- Remove redundancy but keep all actionable insights
- Use clear, concise language
- Choose the most specific/detailed wording when there's overlap

[Output Format]
Return a JSON object with:
- duplicate_groups: Array of objects, each containing:
  - item_indices: Array of integers (indices of duplicate feedbacks)
  - merged_content: String (the merged feedback text)
  - reasoning: String (brief explanation)
- unique_indices: Array of integers (indices of feedbacks with no duplicates)

[Important]
- Every input feedback index must appear EXACTLY ONCE (either in a duplicate_group or in unique_indices)
- Do not miss any feedbacks
- Be conservative - only group true duplicates
- You do NOT need to pick a feedback_name - the system will handle that
